# WorldCupBettings

This is a small Dashboard (programmed using Python) to collect some information about our betting game.

To start the Dashboard, please follow these steps:
- (for the first installation only) Make sure, that pandas, dash, dash-bootstrap-components and plotly is installed.
- Clone this repository to your PC.

Later during the run of the world cup:
- run app.py (f.ex. via "python app.py") in your command line/anaconda prompt and open the displayed local link (f.ex. http://127.0.0.1:8050/).
- Have fun and good luck for your bets.

Please note, that I have to fill in the results manually, so please approach me (Marcel), if there's anything wrong.
